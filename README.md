0. Install git on your machine (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Make a Github account
2. Wait for an invitation to become a contributor (ask for an invitation in discord)
3. Make a new folder on your pc (where the project will be saved)
4. Start the console from that folder (by typing cmd in the navbar) or navigate to that folder in the console
5. Clone this repository by typing "git clone ~link~" where ~link~ is the adress you get when clicking the clone button
6. Configure git -> "git config --global user.name "Your Name"
                 -> "git config --global user.email "Your Email"

7. Test if it worked:
        a) make a new text file (in the folder)
        b) -> "git add ."
        c) -> "git commit -m "a comment to say what you did""
        d) -> "git push"

        a) check for updates in our repo -> "git pull"
        b) work
        c) update our repo with your stuff -> "git add ." + "git commit -m "comment"" + "git push"
